In these notes we have presented the \texttt{Map-Reduce} paradigm and shown how you can implement SQL statements just by using the \texttt{Map} and \texttt{Reduce} functions. Moreover we have shown that \texttt{Joins} are also possible in \texttt{Map-Reduce}. What is left is to implement the grouping functions and aggregate functions on group. This can be done with \texttt{Reduce} as well, but for brevity we do not present it here. The \texttt{Map-Reduce} paradigm is widely used in distributed databases, where the \texttt{Map} function can be run at the same time on multiple servers, and then their result is collected through the \texttt{Reduce} function.
