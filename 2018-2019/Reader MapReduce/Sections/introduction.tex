In these notes we will present the \texttt{Map-Reduce} paradigm, typical of No-SQL systems such as MongoDB or Hadoop. In Section \ref{sec:background} we will provide some background knowledge necessary to understand the topics that will be presented later. In Section \ref{sec:map} we will present the \texttt{Map} function and show that it is equivalent to the SQL \texttt{Select} statement. We will also show how to implement the \texttt{Where} statement with a function similar to \texttt{Map}. In Section \ref{sec:reduce} we will implement the \texttt{Reduce} function and show that with it we can implement \texttt{Where} and \texttt{Join}.
