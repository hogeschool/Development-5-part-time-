\section{Assessment}

The course is tested with an exam made of two parts: a theory part and a practical part. The final grade is determined as follows:\\

\texttt{0.6 * practical + 0.4 * theory}\\

To pass the exam the final score must be $\geq$ than 5.5.
The theory part will contain questions about 
database normalization and transaction concurrency. The practical part will contain programming
exercises about map-reduce and graph databases. The students must bring a working laptop with them
with the necessary tools to run code in C\# and with Neo4j installed.
