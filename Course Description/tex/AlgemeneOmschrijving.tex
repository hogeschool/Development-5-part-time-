\section{General description}
	Databases are ubiquitous within the field of ICT. Many business needs are centered around the gathering, elaboration, etc. of large amounts of data. This data is crucially connected to real-world operations and thus its constant availability and timely elaboration is of unmissable importance. \\
		
		This course covers advanced aspects of data processing and elaboration within the different sets of tradeoffs of the precise but limiting ACID framework and the imprecise but forgiving BASE framework. \\

	\subsection{Relationship with other teaching units}
		This course builds upon the basic programming and database courses. The required knowledge covers topics from object-oriented programming (including lambda abstractions), database design and implementation (ERD and relational modelling), and declarative programming in SQL.
